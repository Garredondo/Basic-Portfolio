                    <p>My name is George Arredondo. I although I have years of work experience, I am new to coding.</p>
                    <br><p>As a native Houstonian I found it hard to leave for college-- so I decided to atttend the University of Houston where I earned a degree in finance. Upon graduating I worked at a small boutique investment banking firm. After about a year I decided to take my career to the next level and pursued a career as a bank examiner with the Texas Department of Banking. I continued on this career path by joining the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.</p>
                    <br><p>In my free time I enjoy films and trying new restuarants. I haven't checked off all the restaurants that are on my bucket list but so far my favorite restuarant is the French Laundry in Yountville, California. Not only is the food great but the service is amazing.</p>
