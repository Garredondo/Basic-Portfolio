# Basic-Portfolio

I am working on the css. On the index page I think I need to fix the container with the description in it to sit, next to the image. 

portfolio page: you need to wrap each description in teal and overlay them over the pictures. 

contact: I need to left align and then figure our where the submit button sends the form.

Overall, I need to figure out how to shrink the container and bring up the footer.
